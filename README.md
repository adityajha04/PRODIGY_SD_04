# PRODIGY_SD_04
ðŸ“Œ Task 4 â€“ Prodigy Infotech Internship (Software Development)

This project is part of Task 4 of my internship at Prodigy Infotech under the Software Development domain. The goal was to build a Java program that can automatically solve a Sudoku puzzle using the backtracking algorithm.

âœ… Features

Accepts a 9x9 Sudoku grid as input (0 denotes empty cells).

Solves the puzzle using recursive backtracking.

Ensures all Sudoku rules are followed:

Each number (1-9) must appear once per row.

Each number must appear once per column.

Each number must appear once in each 3x3 subgrid.

Displays the completed Sudoku grid in a clear format.
